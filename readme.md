Portfolio Site Project:-

The zip file contains the folders css, js, and images for stylesheets, javascript and image files respectively 
which are linked with the project.

The file bootstrap_portfolio.html is the main html file for the portfolio project. 

I have tweaked the design-mockup with images as per my portfolio with upcoming projects which I will be doing in
this Nanodegree course.

There are still lot of modals which I will be adding along with the one for the footer and for each of the 
projects, once all of the upcoming projects get completed one by one.

Also the Github dummy urls I made below each of the images will be updated with their proper links to project on
Github once those upcoming projects are completed and pushed to their respective repositories.
